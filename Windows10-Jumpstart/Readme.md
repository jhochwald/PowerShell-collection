# Windows 10 Jumpstart

The enabling Technology Windows 10 Jumpstart installation

**This will be moved to a seperate repository soon.**

## What is this?

It is part of an internal enabling Technology Project

## How-To

If you apply _all_ the Files to you Windows 10 ISO file and create a bootable image from it, you will have a Jump started Windows 10 Image.

## Please Note

1. Please review all the XML, Batch, and PowerShell Files before you apply them!
2. Download Office 365 (See the Batch) - Review the XML
3. Download the vendor specific files (Removed to prevent any kind of licensing issues)

### Office 365

The XML is still using KMS to activate the Office Suite! You might want to change this to met you own licensing. We will change everything towards online activation in the future!
